        description: "Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought about a significant change in the field of artificial intelligence, where they have transitioned in scope from being specialized research tools to common resources that drive the next generation of software. With increasing model parameters and training data, LLMs demonstrate new abilities in reasoning, code generation, and solving complex problems that were once considered unattainable. However, scaling these models effectively for long-context applications uniquely poses a challenge. This is primarily due to the inherent limitations of the self-attention mechanism, which has quadratic time complexity. This quadratic bottleneck hinders applications for long documents, high-resolution images, and large codebases, among others. However, what is interesting to observe is that effectively only a few parameters are used in token computation, and most calculations are sparse. Hence, sparsity emerges as an effective solution to this problem. Rather than relying on the entire attention matrix, one can utilize an approximate or sparse version of attention to achieve almost the same results much faster. The backbone of this approach is the idea that tokens do not require the entire context; they only need local context, and thus, most of the computation carried out is wasteful. In this blog, we analyze the types of attention patterns that emerge and how to use them to our advantage for faster and efficient LLMs.",

We take a deeper look into the mechanics and interface of the NLE and show that much of the complexity of NetHack is inaccessible due to constraints on the observation and action spaces.

One classic question is How does the reverse process invert the forward process to generate data from pure noise? This article systematically organizes the diffusion model from a fresh Langevin perspective, offering a simpler, clearer, and more intuitive answer. We also address the following questions 1. How can ODE-based and SDE-based diffusion models be unified under a single framework? 2. Why are diffusion models theoretically superior to ordinary VAEs? 3. Why is flow matching not fundamentally simpler than denoising or score matching, but equivalent under maximum-likelihood? We demonstrate that the Langevin Perspective offers clear and straightforward answers to these questions, providing pedagogical value for both learners and experienced researchers seeking deeper intuition.",

This prompts consideration of recurrent structures, where models reuse parameters across sequential time, depth, or training progression to achieve improved performance and reduced training cost. We draw connections in the landscape of parameter reuse, from growing models via stacking to recurrent looping, and postulate that these architectural priors act as a form of Latent Chain of Thought (LCoT), allowing models to reason in a continuous state space. By shifting towards deeper and dynamic computation, grown and recurrent architectures offer a path toward improved reasoning in compact networks, ascending beyond scaling laws of standard architectures.",

        description: "Model misspecification is a critical challenge in simulation-based inference (SBI), particularly in neural SBI methods that use simulated data to train flexible neural density estimators. These methods typically assume that simulators faithfully represent the true data-generating process, an assumption that is often violated in practice. Resulting discrepancies can make observed data effectively out-of-distribution relative to the simulations, leading to biased posterior distributions and misleading uncertainty quantification. This post reviews recent work on model misspecification in neural SBI, covering formal definitions, methods for detection and mitigation, and their underlying assumptions. It also discusses practical implications for SBI workflows and outlines open challenges for developing robust SBI methods that remain reliable in realistic, imperfectly specified applications.",

        description: "Park et al., 2025 find that when large language models process random walks on a graph in-context, the geometry of their token representations comes to mirror the graph&#39;s connectivity structure. This suggests a two-step mechanism: the model first reshapes its representations to reflect the graph structure, then operates over them to predict valid next steps. We offer a simpler mechanistic explanation. The in-context graph tracing task can be solved by induction circuits, which implement a simple rule: if token B followed token A earlier in the sequence, predict B the next time A appears. Since consecutive tokens in a random walk are always graph neighbors, this rule naturally produces valid steps. Ablating the attention heads that comprise induction circuits substantially degrades task performance, compared to ablating random heads. As for the geometric structure of representations, we propose that induction circuits can account for this too: their previous-token heads mix each token&#39;s representation with that of its predecessor, always a graph neighbor in a random walk. We show that a single round of such &#39;neighbor mixing&#39; applied to random embeddings is sufficient to recreate the graph-like PCA structure. These results suggest that the observed representation geometry is a byproduct of how the model solves the task, not the means by which it does so.",

        description: "I present diffusion models as part of a family of machine learning techniques that withhold information from a model’s input and train it to guess the withheld information. I argue that diffusion&#39;s destroying approach to withholding is more flexible than typical hand-crafted information withholding techniques, providing a rich training playground that could be advantageous in some settings, notably data-scarce ones. I then address subtle issues that may arise when porting reinforcement learning techniques to the diffusion context, and wonder how such exploration problems could be addressed in more diffusion-native ways. I do not have definitive answers, but I do point my fingers in directions I deem interesting. A tutorial follows this thesis, expanding on the destroy-then-generate perspective. A novel kind of probabilistic graphical models is introduced to facilitate the tutorial&#39;s exposition.",

        description: "Compositionality is thought to be crucial in human cognition and AI, but we lack a scientific understanding of what it is. What kind of data is compositionally structured? Can we mathematically quantify the amount and character of compositional structure? This blog post introduces a novel approach for doing so, building off of existing tools from algorithmic information theory that formalize notions of complexity and structure. The mathematical definition of compositionality that we&#39;ll come to is rigorous, precise, and general, and the hope is that it can inspire novel research directions in AI for uncovering compositional structure in natural data.",

        description: "Tabular foundation models such as TabPFN are limited in practice by the memory cost of attention, which grows quadratically with the number of samples and features. While efficient attention backends alleviate this in principle, CUDA grid limits and hardware compatibility gaps prevent their direct application at the scale of real-world tabular datasets. We introduce Chunked TabPFN, an exact tiling strategy that removes these implementation bottlenecks without retraining or approximation, extending TabPFN to 100K+ rows on a single GPU. On the long-context slice of TabArena, we find that — contrary to earlier reports — TabPFN&#39;s performance continues to improve with larger contexts, suggesting that the prior bottleneck was implementation-level memory, not model-level capacity.",

        description: "For most of the history of information retrieval (IR), search results were designed for human consumers who could scan, filter, and discard irrelevant information on their own. This shaped retrieval systems to optimize for finding and ranking more relevant documents, but not keeping results clean and minimal, as the human was the final filter. However, LLMs have changed that by lacking this filtering ability. To address this, we introduce Bits-over-Random (BoR), a chance-corrected measure of retrieval selectivity that reveals when high success rates mask random-level performance.",

        description: "Autoregressive (AR) models are central to modern generative AI systems, yet their need for an ordered sequence of tokens clashes with modalities that lack an obvious ordering, such as images, graphs, and point clouds. Despite this mismatch, AR models are widely applied beyond language owing to their scalability and controllability. In this post, we articulate exactly what the problem is, and how it can be solved. In short, there are two broad classes of techniques for applying AR models to non-sequential data: selecting a generation order given some fixed tokenization scheme, and redesigning the tokenization itself to simplify next-token prediction. Yet these methods face tradeoffs, particularly between compression (how many bits are used to represent the input) and autoregressive &amp;quot;modelability&amp;quot; (how easy it is to model each next-token conditional distribution in the chosen order). We predict that as data-hungry AI pipelines require new data modalities to train integrated, multi-modal models, these considerations will only grow more crucial. By drawing these connections, we aim to motivate future work on tokenizations tailored to the needs of autoregressive models for arbitrary datatypes.",
