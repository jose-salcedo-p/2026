title: "Square Peg, Round Hole: Plugging Non-Sequential Data into Sequential Language Models"
description: "Autoregressive (AR) models are central to modern generative AI systems, yet their need for an ordered sequence of tokens clashes with modalities that lack an obvious ordering, such as images, graphs, and point clouds. Despite this mismatch, AR models are widely applied beyond language owing to their scalability and controllability. In this post, we articulate exactly what the problem is, and how it can be solved. In short, there are two broad classes of techniques for applying AR models to non-sequential data: selecting a generation order given some fixed tokenization scheme, and redesigning the tokenization itself to simplify next-token prediction. Yet these methods face tradeoffs, particularly between compression (how many bits are used to represent the input) and autoregressive &quot;modelability&quot; (how easy it is to model each next-token conditional distribution in the chosen order). We predict that as data-hungry AI pipelines require new data modalities to train integrated, multi-modal models, these considerations will only grow more crucial. By drawing these connections, we aim to motivate future work on tokenizations tailored to the needs of autoregressive models for arbitrary datatypes."

# Introduction
Autoregressive sequence models sit at the center of modern generative AI, excelling in settings like natural language where data arrive in a well-defined sequence. However, many important modalities do not immediately offer such a linear structure. Images, graphs, point clouds, and sets lack an intrinsic notion of “the next token.”

    How can one apply sequential models to non-sequential (e.g. non-language) data? (Note that we will use “autoregressive model” and “sequential model” interchangeably.)
</div>

Despite this apparent mismatch between modeling assumption and data structure, autoregressive (AR) models have been repeatedly applied in such non-lingual settings <d-cite key="Antunes2024,10.1609/aaai.v39i24.34804,sun2024autoregressivemodelbeatsdiffusion"></d-cite>. There are good reasons: AR models offer variable-length generation, precise likelihoods, flexible conditioning, and step-by-step controllability <d-cite key="wang2024diverse,chen2024diffusion"></d-cite>. From a practical perspective, autoregressive models have been engineered and scaled to perfection, with well-established scaling laws, training recipes, and ready-to-use open source libraries.

This blog post explores the emerging landscape of techniques for turning non-sequential data into discrete 1D sequences, which autoregressive models are designed to process. It is intended for a diverse audience, including anyone who wishes to design machine learning systems for non-sequential data (images, molecules, point clouds, etc). 

We start with a primer on autoregressive modeling, including tokenization and positional encodings. Readers familiar with these concepts already should skip ahead to the following [section](#what-exactly-are-tokens), which defines “non-sequential data”. We then categorize recent research into two distinct kinds of approaches: **modeling-level methods**, which optimize the generation order for a fixed set of tokens, and **tokenization-level methods**, which redesign the discrete input representation itself to align with a sequential prior. In the case of tokenization-level methods, we highlight the tradeoff between compressibility and modelability. Although these methods often originate in different communities and target different modalities, they are instances of the same underlying challenge. 

## Primer on autoregressive modeling 

From the early days of recursive neural networks to the current transformer revolution, **Autoregressive Models (ARMs)** have emerged as a central paradigm for sequence-based generative modeling. By treating data as a series of discrete tokens (drawn from some finite vocabulary) and modeling their joint distribution through next-token prediction, machine learning systems achieve strong performance on tasks ranging from fluent text generation to complex program synthesis <d-cite key="chen2021evaluatinglargelanguagemodels,openai2024gpt4technicalreport"></d-cite>. 

A central assumption behind ARMs is that data can be meaningfully factorized into a sequence of tokens,
$$ x = (x_1,\dots,x_n)$$
where each token depends on those who came before it. Although **any** sequence of data can be factorized as 

$$ p(x_1,\dots,x_n)=p(x_1)p(x_2\mid x_1)p(x_3 \mid x_1,x_2)\dots $$

via the chain rule, by “meaningfully” we refer to how easy it is to model each of the individual factors $$p(x_i \mid x_1,\dots,x_{i-1})$$ — more on this in the next section.  

Under this factorization, the model is trained to predict the next token $x_i$ given the context of preceding tokens $x_1,\dots,x_{i-1}$. In transformers, this is implemented via causal masking, where the self-attention mechanism prevents any position from attending to "future" tokens.

## What exactly are tokens?
An autoregressive model operates on a sequence of discrete tokens representing a piece of data. But what exactly are tokens, and how are they computed? At first, processing inputs into tokens might seem unnecessary. For example, one could just input the raw byte sequence (e.g. UTF-8 values for text) into an autoregressive model. However, byte sequences can become very long, making long-range dependencies harder to learn and obscuring meaningful linguistic structure that the model could otherwise exploit. As a result, byte-level models often require more computation and struggle to match the efficiency and performance of systems that use more semantically informed units <d-cite key="10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33013159"></d-cite>. 

Thus enters **tokenization**: the process of mapping raw data into a sequence of discrete symbols drawn from a finite vocabulary[^discrete]. For text data, the most commonly used tokenization schemes such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) <d-cite key="sennrich-etal-2016-neural"></d-cite>, WordPiece <d-cite key="devlin-etal-2019-bert"></d-cite>, or unigram tokenization segment strings into subword units:

* “tokenization” → [‘token’, ‘ization’]

* “codebook” → [‘code’, ‘book’]

Subword methods strike a balance between vocabulary size and sequence length, whereas byte-level tokenization uses a near-minimal vocabulary that results in no information loss but produces considerably longer sequences. (Note: there’s a recent and interesting line of work on tokenization-free methods operating at the byte level[^byte], but they too are designed for sequential data.) These choices reflect a fundamental tension in tokenizer design: **a tokenizer optimized purely for compression (i.e. the best reconstruction per bit budget) is not necessarily the one that is easiest for a generative model to predict one-by-one** (as evidenced by e.g. <d-cite key="lester2024training"></d-cite>, who demonstrate that a naive compression-based tokenizer works poorly for language modeling). Later sections will revisit this reconstruction-generation tradeoff.

Each token is moreover associated with a positional encoding, which encodes that token’s position in the sequence and breaks the native permutational invariance of the attention mechanism. However, even without positional encodings, the causal attention mask of autoregressive models still forces token generation to occur in a specific order. Thus, simply removing positional encodings does not fundamentally change the sequential nature of causal attention, as demonstrated in <d-cite key="haviv-etal-2022-transformer"></d-cite>.

# “Sequential” vs. “non-sequential” data

We’ve alluded to the idea that autoregressive models rely on a *meaningful* factorization of the data into a sequence, but that certain data is “non-sequential”. What does this mean exactly? Spoken and written language are clearly “sequential” in a meaningful way: they are both generated in, and meant to be consumed in, a certain temporal sequence. But if someone asked you to order the pixels from an image into a sequence, what would you choose? Raster order? Top-to-bottom, or bottom-to-top? How about the atoms in a molecule? 

Perhaps you would answer that it depends on what you want to use the sequence for. Images, molecular graphs, and 3D point clouds are defined by spatial relationships and symmetries, but there is no single, canonical ordering of elements on which all readers of this post would agree. To distinguish between orderings, we require the notion of **modelability for autoregressive models**. 

At a high-level, modelability is a general and ubiquitous idea in representation learning: simply put, some representations are easier for models to learn from than others. This perspective echoes the notion of *usable information* <d-cite key="Xu2020A,dieleman2025latents"></d-cite> and, more recently, *epiplexity* <d-cite key="finzi2026entropyepiplexityrethinkinginformation"></d-cite>, both of which emphasize that what matters is not just how much information a representation contains, but how much of it is accessible to a computationally bounded learner or model class. A similar view appears in the rate–distortion–usefulness tradeoff[^tradeoff] proposed in <d-cite key="tschannen2018recentadvancesautoencoderbasedrepresentation"></d-cite>, where “usefulness” for a downstream model depends on how that information is organized. 

We focus here on the specific notion of modelability for autoregressive models. The data representation is now not a single vector per datapoint, but a sequence of discrete tokens $x_1,\dots,x_n$ per datapoint. Since autoregressive models factor the data distribution as 
$\prod_{i=1}^n p(x_i \mid x_{<i})$,
 modelability asks: are the induced conditional distributions $p(x_i \mid x_{<i})$ **learnable by your model class**? Formally, we can write this as the expected cross-entropy (CE) loss (denoted by $\ell(\text{distribution}, \text{true label})$) of the best next-token prediction model $p_{\theta^*}$ from the model class: 
 $$
 \mathbb{E}_{x_1,\dots,x_n} \ell \left(p_\theta(\cdot \mid x_{< i}), x_i \right)
 $$

Here, the “best” model is that produced by a training procedure (usually, optimizing for the same CE loss) over a finite training set. 

In words, the autoregressive modelability of a tokenization is simply the test perplexity of the best next-token prediction model. Language (under any standard tokenizer) is highly modelable because next-token models do a good job at, well, predicting the next tokens. Note that modelability is a property of a **specific tokenization** of a data distribution, not the modality itself. For any data distribution and model class, we can ask what tokenization yields the optimal modelability score (the equation above). Thus, this notion of modelability implicitly depends on the inductive biases and computational limitations (e.g., finite context length and recency bias) of the model class. This naturally dovetails with the theory of tokenization developed in <d-cite key="rajaraman2025theorytokenizationllms"></d-cite>, where the advantages of tokenization were related to the limitations of the transformer, which tended to learn unigram models in their setting.

In this sense, the dichotomy of “sequential” and “non-sequential” is overly simplistic, since one can arbitrarily pick a sequence for any input data. What we really ask is, based on domain knowledge or just common sense, is there an **obviously modelable** sequence? If not, we call the modality “non-sequential”, and assert that more complex methods are needed to identify a modelable tokenization (more on this later)[^ordering]. 

## When sequence choice affects modelability

The difference in modelability between different tokens orders is especially clear in domains where different prediction orders induce subproblems of highly varying difficulty. For example, consider training a model to solve Sudoku puzzles. At a given current state, some cells might be nearly forced, while others are highly ambiguous -- so, the difficulty of the prediction subproblem depends strongly on which cell is predicted first. As explored in <d-cite key="kim2025train"></d-cite>, changing the prediction order of the unfilled Sudoku tiles can shift the model from easy, highly-constrained cases to much harder, underdetermined ones.

  <div class="caption" style="text-align: center;">

  </div>
</div>

A similar example appears in arithmetic tasks, where models have been observed to perform better when generating blocks of digits right-to-left than left-to-right, perhaps reflecting how carries propagate in the computation <d-cite key="singh2024tokenizationcountsimpacttokenization,lee2024digitstodecisions"></d-cite>. Across these settings, a consistent pattern emerges: prediction orders that better align with a task’s underlying structure tend to be more effective. 

To clearly demonstrate the impact of information order on modelability, we ran a simple demonstration using graphical models (code available [here](https://github.com/hannahlawrence/graph_token_ordering)). We generate data from a Markov chain over a discrete vocabulary, letting each node in the Markov chain correspond to its own token for simplicity. The only free parameter in defining the tokenization is then the ordering of those tokens. Ultimately, datapoints are sequences of discrete token values, drawn from a Markov chain and ordered according to some strategy (described below). Then, we train a small decoder-only transformer to represent the data distribution, measuring the test cross-entropy achieved at the point of optimal validation loss. 


We compare three different ordering strategies:
1. **Topological**: Using the natural ordering of the nodes, according to a topological sort of the Markov chain.
2. **Fixed Random**: Using a random (fixed) ordering of the nodes.
3. **Random per-instance**: Using a random ordering of the nodes, which changes with each datapoint (but with the original position encoded, so that information is not lost).

Note that positional encodings are used to capture both the original and post-ordering positions of each token.

  </div>
</div>

We also vary the context length of the causal attention model, the number of nodes in the Markov chain, and the size of the dataset, all to modulate the difficulty of the learning task. As shown, the natural ordering of nodes achieves the best loss in all cases. Only in the easiest setting (with smallest vocabulary, largest training set, and full context length) does the performance gap close between the two fixed orderings, whereas the randomized ordering method remains suboptimal.

</div>

Hopefully, this drives home the point that **not all orderings are created equal**.

Applying standard language modeling objectives to non-sequential data requires us to force a square peg into a round hole: we must linearize the intrinsic geometry of the data into a flat sequence. This raises a challenge: **how should sequential models operate when there is no intrinsic order to exploit?**

# Can we just use non-sequential models?
Given that many modalities lack a natural left-to-right structure, one might reasonably ask: *why use autoregressive models at all?* Indeed, some of the most popular alternative frameworks -- like generative Masked Language Models (MLMs) <d-cite key="li2024promises"></d-cite> and diffusion models <d-cite key="Ho2020"></d-cite>, as well as the burgeoning field of diffusion LLMs <d-cite key="nie2025large"></d-cite> -- avoid one-token-at-a-time prediction, and operate on entire sequences at once. 

However, compared to autoregressive models, these non-sequential architectures sacrifice several desirable properties, including variable-length outputs, flexible conditioning, efficient sampling with the KV cache, and step-wise guidance. Thus, there remain many settings in which applying autoregressive methods is still desirable <d-cite key="chen2024diffusion"></d-cite>[^AR_diffusion].

A well-studied domain where the lack of an inherent ordering becomes especially salient is vision. Images do not come with a built-in sequence structure, yet significant effort has been devoted to making them autoregressively modelable. Let’s start with this domain as a case study, before diving into more recent trends of tokenization-model alignment.

# Images as sequences: an illustrative example
Images have no inherent traversal order, yet to apply autoregressive models, we must linearize them into a 1D sequence. The earliest attempts, such as PixelRNN <d-cite key="10.5555/3045390.3045575"></d-cite>, flattened the image into a sequence of raw pixels and predicted them one by one in raster scan order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right). One limiting factor of pixel-level flattening was that it would result in very long sequences that are difficult to model (e.g., a 256 x 256 image results in a sequence of length 65,536). In fact, this is the same reason that tokenization arose for language <d-cite key="sennrich-etal-2016-neural"></d-cite>!

To solve the sequence length problem, the fundamental unit of computation shifted from pixels to patches. This strategy was standardized by Vision Transformers (ViTs) <d-cite key="dosovitskiy2021an"></d-cite>: divide the image into fixed-size squares (e.g., 16 x 16), embed each patch as a token with positional encodings, and arrange them in a sequence. Crucially, ViTs retained the raster scan order, as shown at the bottom of the following figure. 

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">
  <div style="display: inline-block; width: 70%;">

  </div>
</div>

The modern paradigm of autoregressive models for images adopts this patch-based approach via the following two-stage architecture: 

1. **Stage 1 - Tokenization**: Models first compress the image into a codebook drawn from a learned visual dictionary, e.g. using a VQGAN <d-cite key="esser2020taming"></d-cite> or VQ-VAE <d-cite key="vandenOord2017"></d-cite>. The tokenizer is trained once, typically with reconstruction or perceptual losses, and then frozen. 

2. **Stage 2 - Modeling**: A separate autoregressive (AR) Transformer is trained on the learned tokens in raster order.

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">
  <div style="display: inline-block; width: 100%;">

    %}
    <div class="caption" style="text-align: center;">
      Autoregressive image modeling tends to follow a two-step approach. In the first stage, discrete image tokens are trained using a reconstruction loss. In the second stage, the now-fixed tokens are fed into a transformer for generation.
    </div> 
  </div>
</div>

Although VQ-VAE and VQGAN tokenizers learn a visual “vocabulary”, they do not remove the need for a fixed ordering: the tokens are still ordered for input to the transformer. Thus, the **inherent mismatch between the prediction order and the causal structure of natural images remains**: predicting a patch from only previously raster-ordered predecessors might force the model to commit to global structural decisions (e.g., “this is a dog”) based on ambiguous local evidence (e.g., a patch of fur in the top-left corner).  This is just one example of how a representation can induce conditional prediction tasks as subproblems that are poorly aligned with the modality’s underlying structure. With this as motivation, we now turn to the general problem of aligning sequential models with non-sequential data.

# Aligning sequential models and non-sequential data
Earlier, we noted a basic tension: representations that perfectly preserve all the information in the data can make generation more expensive and/or difficult (e.g. PixelRNN), while representations that near-optimally compress the underlying signal, do so to the detriment of generation <d-cite key="lester2024training"></d-cite>. While these two notions, of compression and modelability, are not strictly at odds with one another, they are simply different objectives that need not align in practice. A common thought experiment that demonstrates this is that of a constant tokenization -- trivial to model, but a terrible compressor <d-cite key="ramanujan2025when"></d-cite>. The goal, then, is to balance these two objectives: to make sequential modeling easier without giving up too much reconstruction quality.

The emerging methods for navigating this tradeoff can be organized into two distinct categories. One approach keeps the token vocabulary, and therefore the reconstruction quality, fixed, but modifies the *modeling procedure* so that the existing sequence becomes easier to generate (still autoregressively). The other approach keeps the modeling procedure fixed but changes the *tokenization itself*, aiming to find representations that are jointly good for reconstruction and sequential prediction.

In other words, the two overarching categories of approaches are:
* **Modeling-level**: Given a fixed tokenization, adjust or learn an optimal ordering.
* **Tokenization-level**: Given a desired ordering, adjust or learn the tokenization itself so that the resulting tokens are better aligned with it.

We further subdivide these categories according to the following flowchart, which serves as a roadmap for the remainder of the post.

    Approaches for addressing the mismatch between sequential model and non-sequential data.
</div>

## Modeling-level: optimizing the prediction order
When a modality lacks an intrinsic traversal order, the challenge is to decide (or discover) the prediction order that leads to the easiest, most structurally coherent subproblems for a model to learn. To reiterate, we’re assuming here that the tokenization is fixed, but the modelling procedure is no longer restricted to this fixed, left-to-right order. There are three broad techniques for doing this: (1) marginalizing over orderings, (2) learning an ordering, or (3) heuristically choosing an order. 

### Marginalizing over orderings
What if we simply train the model to be robust to *any* sequence using data augmentation? This is precisely the method behind **Any-Order Autoregressive Models (AO-ARMs)**, where the model is trained under random orderings drawn uniformly from all permutations of the input sequence <d-cite key="Uria2013ADA"></d-cite>. Given a permutation $\sigma$ of indices $\{1,\dots,n\}$, the learned distribution factorizes as
$$p(\mathbf{x} \mid \sigma) = \Pi_{i=1}^n p(x_{\sigma_i} \mid \mathbf{x}_{\sigma_{<i}})$$
where $\sigma_{<i}$ corresponds to indices $\{1, \ldots, i-1\}$ under the permutation σ. In this formulation, the permutation can be interpreted as a latent variable that specifies which conditional subproblem the model solves at each step. 
<div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">
  <div style="display: inline-block; max-width: 450px; width: 100%;">
    {% include figure.liquid 
        path="assets/img/2026-04-27-autoregressive-tokenization/aoarm4_cropped.gif" 
        class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"
    %}
    <div class="caption" style="text-align: center;">
      Any-order autoregressive models predict next-token distributions over randomly selected token orderings.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

Moreover, each permutation effectively defines a masking pattern: at step $$i$$, the model observes the variables in $\sigma_{<i}$ and treats all variables in $\sigma_{>i}$ as unobserved. Training across many permutations therefore exposes the model to a wide variety of partially observed inputs and forces it to learn conditional distributions of the form
 $$p(x_i \mid \mathbf{x}_{-i}),$$
which is the same family of conditionals targeted by masked language models. As noted by <d-cite key="kim2025train"></d-cite>, **AO-ARMs can be viewed as an autoregressive reformulation of the masked language modeling objective**, differing only in whether the observed subset is chosen by a permutation or by an explicit mask. 

A related approach is σ-GPT <d-cite key="10.1007/978-3-031-70368-3_9"></d-cite>, which also trains on random permutations but uses burst sampling for faster generation, as well as curriculum learning (gradually increasing the model’s exposure to random permutations during training). 

### Heuristically choosing the order

AO-ARMs above take the view that, once a token vocabulary is fixed, the remaining structural choice is the *order* in which tokens are predicted. The default any-order training treats this latent variable as uniformly distributed over all permutations, which forces the model to learn a wide family of conditionals. The methods[^canon] in this section ask a more targeted question: can we pick a specific order that actually makes prediction easier?

For example, Kim et al. <d-cite key="kim2025train"></d-cite> implement this idea in a masked diffusion model <d-cite key="lou2024discrete"></d-cite> that can fill tokens in arbitrary positions, greedily selecting the next token with the lowest predictive entropy (“most confident first”). This avoids ambiguous subproblems and improves performance (e.g., on Sudoku), and even helps ARMs when the learned ordering is reused during training. Similarly, Pramanik et al. <d-cite key="pramanik2025distillingsemanticallyawareorders"></d-cite> show that for images, adaptively choosing the next patch based on a scoring heuristic and fine-tuning on these paths yields a more semantic generation order and better FID than raster scans. Across these works, ordering becomes a heuristic search problem: even simple rules for “what to predict next” can make autoregressive generation substantially easier. 

### Learning the order
Rather than using a heuristic, Wang et al. <d-cite key="wang2025learningorder"></d-cite> directly parametrize the ordering via a neural network. In **Learning Order Autoregressive Models (LO-ARMs)**, the ordering is treated explicitly as a latent variable: the model learns an order-policy
$$p_x(\sigma) = \Pi_i p(\sigma_i \mid \sigma_{<i}, x_{\sigma_{<i}})$$
that, given a partially masked input, chooses a position to unmask next. At the same time, a shared model (UNet for images, Graph Transformer for molecules) produces value logits for every position. Once the order-policy selects a position $$\sigma_i$$, the model applies a softmax to choose **what value to place there**. The resulting orderings were found to reflect coherent structural patterns, such as placing border pixels in images or bond structures in molecular graphs first in the ordering!

A closely related learned-ordering approach is **REOrder** <d-cite key="kutscher2025reorderingpatchesimprovesvision"></d-cite>, which also trains a policy network to select the next position, and then trains an autoregressive model to follow the discovered task-optimal ordering.

The modeling-level methods show that reordering can meaningfully reduce the difficulty of the generative task, but only within the limits imposed by the underlying tokenization. Since the representation itself is fixed, these approaches cannot introduce coarse-to-fine structure or reshape the information content of the tokens; they can only choose a more favorable sequence in which to model them. As a result, **modeling-level alignment can improve modelability, but its flexibility in exploring the reconstruction-generation tradeoff is limited.**

## Tokenization-level: optimizing input representations
Suppose we don’t want to mess around with the somewhat complicated strategies above. Tokenization-level methods are motivated by the following question: how can we simply provide sequential models with the “most sequential,” i.e. most modelable, representation of the input data? If the model generates autoregressively, then the tokenizer can be designed with autoregressive generation in mind from the start!. These methods address the reconstruction-generation tradeoff directly at the representation level, rather than merely reordering the prediction path. 

### Heuristically encouraging AR modelability
A natural starting point is to impose an ordering that we have good reason to believe (e.g. based on domain intuition) will be easier for an autoregressive model to learn. Instead of relying on the model to discover a useful sequence structure on its own, we can choose an ordering that reflects how information in the modality is organized. A prominent example is **Visual Autoregressive Modeling** <d-cite key="tian2024visual"></d-cite>, which aims to align the prediction order with the hierarchical structure of images. VAR  follows a **next-scale** prediction strategy, predicting coarse global structure first and then refining with higher-resolution tokens[^diffusion]. By replacing a rigid raster order with a more semantically coherent prediction schedule, VAR closed much of the historical gap between AR and diffusion models in metrics such as image quality, inference speed, data efficiency, and scalability.

<div class="caption" style="text-align: center;">
    Figure from <d-cite key="tian2024visual"></d-cite>. AR and VAR both perform sequential generation, but AR generates one patch at a time, whereas VAR generates a (globally) better-resolved image with each timestep.
</div>

This shift from "next-patch" to "next-scale" prediction reframes what it means for images to be “non-sequential”, and illustrates the flexibility that comes with modifying the data representation directly (rather than just the ordering of predefined tokens). While there is no obvious choice of order in the spatial dimension, VAR suggests that the ordering along the resolution dimension is highly modelable in an autoregressive manner. 

Several works build on this coarse-to-fine perspective by allowing for a variable number of tokens per image, where shorter sequences correspond to more global descriptions while longer sequences progressively increase fidelity <d-cite key="cai2025matryoshka,bachmann2025flextok,miwa2025onedpieceimagetokenizermeets"></d-cite>. In doing so, they also tackle a core limitation of the fixed-size patch grid in standard tokenizers, where every image is forced into the same number of tokens regardless of its complexity. A plain sky and a dense texture both consume the same token budget, creating inefficiency for simple images and information loss for complex ones. Instead, sequence length can track the information density of the image.

The same principle likely extends beyond computer vision. For molecules, you might generate the scaffold before filling in functional groups; for 3D shapes, you might block out coarse structure before refining details. In other words, the easiest sequence for a model to follow may be one that moves from low to high complexity or resolution, rather than marching linearly through space. And that "best" path doesn’t have to be semantically interpretable. Beyond explicit hierarchies like resolution, we expect that many high-dimensional datasets possess hidden latent structures that define a natural generation order, even if it is abstract and invisible to human observers[^language].

Identifying the most modelable order may require deep domain knowledge in most settings. This, in turn, motivates methods that dispense with predefined heuristics and instead build autoregressive-friendly structure directly into the learned tokenization.

### Autoregressive priors
In the standard two-stage tokenization-generation paradigm, Stage 1 and Stage 2 are often treated as independent problems. The tokenizer minimizes reconstruction loss, while the generator minimizes prediction loss. However, a tokenizer that is optimal for reconstruction with a global, bidirectional decoder is often suboptimal for autoregressive generation. 

To bridge this gap, recent works have introduced an autoregressive prior directly into the Stage 1 training process. By enforcing causal constraints during tokenization, these methods ensure the resulting codebook aligns with the sequential nature of the downstream generator. Some representative examples include **Causally Regularized Tokenization (CRT)** <d-cite key="ramanujan2025when"></d-cite>, which adds a next-token loss on continuous latents; **Aligned Tokenizer (AliTok)** <d-cite key="wu2025sequencemodelingalignmenttokenizer"></d-cite>, which enforces causal decoding during tokenization; and **Learned AutoRegressive generative Prior (LARP)** <d-cite key="wang2025larp"></d-cite>  which applies an autoregressive prior to a subset of learned global tokens. We visualize these techniques in the figure below.

<div class="caption" style="text-align: center;">
    Three approaches to incorporating autoregressive priors during tokenization. CRT <d-cite key="ramanujan2025when"></d-cite> adds next-token prediction on continuous latents, AliTok <d-cite key="wu2025sequencemodelingalignmenttokenizer"></d-cite> imposes causal decoding during Stage 1 but relaxes it during Stage 2, and LARP <d-cite key="wang2025larp"></d-cite> applies an AR prior only to global query tokens produced by a stochastic quantizer.
</div>

These methods explicitly build sequentiality directly into the learned tokenizer, using general learning techniques rather than heuristics.

# What is the future for non-sequential data?

In sum, autoregressive models offer a flexible, efficient method for generative modeling tasks, but they require tokens to be input in some ordering. However, many modalities of interest outside language lack a clear, natural ordering for tokenization. Although one can simply choose an arbitrary ordering convention, it may not optimize the resultant model’s generation quality. This is the notion of “modelability,” which we apply specifically to autoregressive models. To improve the autoregressive modelability of arbitrary modalities, model-based approaches broadly attempt to find the most modelable ordering of some fixed tokenization. In contrast, tokenization-based approaches take sequential generation into account when constructing the tokenization itself. This encourages ordered tokenizations that are easy to incrementally predict. In a scattered landscape of diverse tokenization and ordering strategies, we hope to have provided not just a methodological survey, but a unifying perspective.

For researchers who work with boutique architectures or non-language data modalities, we want to highlight tokenization and “sequential-ization” as promising directions for future research -- in particular, modality-specific tokenization methods that anticipate the sequential nature of their downstream model and align with it. Notably, most existing alignment strategies have been explored primarily in the image domain, leaving substantial room for discovering analogous structures in other forms of data.

There are many possible routes for the future of non-sequential data. Perhaps specialized architectures for each modality will win out in the end, and the mismatch we expound upon in this blogpost won’t be relevant! But at this point, it seems highly unlikely that the application of large, generalist sequential models for non-sequential data will disappear entirely. After all, even agents calling specialized models as tools must be able to describe the objects of interest with a sequence of tokens. Thus, the square peg for the round hole remains.

[^discrete]: Recent work has explored the use of continuous or “soft” tokens with an infinite vocabulary to allow for a more semantically rich latent space <d-cite key="tschannen2025jetformer"></d-cite>.

[^byte]: Recent “tokenization-free” approaches have moved away from the tokenization paradigm, which suffers from various idiosyncrasies and challenges for multilingual data <d-cite key="neitemeier2025hierarchical"></d-cite>. Instead of committing to a predefined vocabulary or a fixed sequence structure, approaches such as the Byte Latent Transformer <d-cite key="pagnoni-etal-2025-byte"></d-cite> and H-Net <d-cite key="hwang2025dynamicchunkingendtoendhierarchical"></d-cite> let the representational units evolve during generation. If the model can decide how to construct these building blocks as it trains, then the tokenization becomes an emergent property of the model’s inference dynamics, rather than something constructed ahead of time. While promising as methods for transcending hand-designed, modality-specific tokenizations, both of these models **remain autoregressive**. In other words, they both work with fixed sequences of bytes. Thus, the mismatch between sequential models and non-sequential data is relevant for tokenization-free methods, too!

[^tradeoff]: The tradeoff between modelability and reconstruction is not strict (“if A increases, B necessarily decreases”): indeed, model-level approaches to computing the optimal ordering of tokens preserve reconstruction while improving modelability. However, the two are generally competing objectives. For example, as noted in CRT <d-cite key="ramanujan2025when"></d-cite>, the optimally modelable tokenization is a single constant token, which fails at reconstruction.

[^ordering]: In this blogpost, we talk a lot about permuting data tokens. However, naively permuting tokens clearly doesn’t make sense for domains like language or vision: the sentence “Work is more important than family” has the opposite meaning from its permutation, “Family is more important than work” (as is famously capitalized upon in Jonathan Reed’s reversible poem “The Lost Generation” -- a clever work that can be read forwards and backwards, with diametrically opposed meanings). Similarly, permuting the pixels of an image can create an entirely new image. In contrast, permuting the points in a point cloud or nodes in a graph preserves the underlying object, and therefore doesn’t lose any information. Thus, when we talk about permuting data tokens, what we really mean is changing the *generation order* -- while retaining the information describing the input object itself.

[^AR_diffusion]: There is a growing line of work aiming to combine the strengths of autoregressive and diffusion models <d-cite key="hoogeboom2022autoregressive,chen2024diffusion,arriola2025block"></d-cite>. We set these aside in this post, as our focus is specifically on autoregressive models.

[^canon]: There are also several works which perform input canonicalization, i.e. choosing an optimal permutation of input data for in-context learning <d-cite key="Lu2021FantasticallyOP"></d-cite> or graph generation <d-cite key="kim2023learning"></d-cite>. Although these approaches also learn an optimal ordering of the input data, they differ from most of the approaches we discuss in the blogpost by committing to an ordering all at once, rather than incrementally as generation progresses.

[^diffusion]: This loosely parallels the way diffusion models reconstruct signals by first resolving low-frequency components and then adding higher-frequency detail. Dieleman <d-cite key="dieleman2025latents"></d-cite> gives an intuitive explanation of the viewpoint that "diffusion is spectral autoregression", and Falck <d-cite key="falck2025fourier"></d-cite> offers a complementary analysis that clarifies the conditions under which the connection holds.

[^language]: Even when there is a canonical ordering for the input, it might not be the most faithful to the underlying generative process. For example, one could imagine that the “best” ordering for certain language modeling tasks might be structured according to some hierarchy of abstract concepts or reasoning steps rather than the default left-to-right sequence. There is thus a growing body of work on Transformers that operate in a latent token space <d-cite key="sun2025enhancinglatentcomputationtransformers"></d-cite>.
