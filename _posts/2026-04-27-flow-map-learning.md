title: From Trajectories to Operators — A Unified Flow Map Perspective on Generative Modeling
description:  In this post, we reframe continuous-time generative modeling from integrating trajectories to learning two-time operators (flow maps). This operator view unifies diffusion, flow matching, and consistency models, and suggests a practical diagnostic — semigroup-consistent jumps yield both step-robust generation and low compositional drift. We derive Eulerian/Lagrangian distillation objectives and use inpainting experiments to show why semigroup-consistent jumps can be both step-robust and composition-stable.

## 1. Background and Motivation

The landscape of continuous-time generative modeling has largely crystallized into three dominant lineages, each defining a specific relationship between a complex data distribution and a simple prior.


*   **Score-based Diffusion (SDEs) <d-cite key="song2019generative,song2020score"></d-cite>:** Models learn the score function $\nabla_x \log p_t(x)$ to reverse a stochastic diffusion process. Sampling requires simulating a reverse-time SDE or its deterministic probability-flow ODE:
  
    $$
    \frac{dx}{dt} = f(x, t) - \frac{g^2(t)}{2}\,s_{\theta}(x_t, t).
    $$
    
*   **Flow Matching (CNFs) / Rectified flow <d-cite key="lipman2022flow,liu2022flow"></d-cite>:** Instead of deriving dynamics from a forward diffusion, Flow Matching directly regresses a velocity field $v_\theta(x,t)$ that pushes a Gaussian source probability path toward the data target:
  
    $$
    \frac{dx}{dt} = v_\theta(x,t).
    $$

*   **Consistency Models (CMs) <d-cite key="song2023consistency"></d-cite>:** Aiming for speed, CMs attempt to bypass integration entirely by learning a map $f_\theta$ that projects any point on a trajectory directly to its origin ($t=0$):
  
    $$
    f_\theta(x_t,t) \approx x_0 \implies f_\theta(x_t,t) = f_\theta(x_{t'}, t').
    $$



Despite their success, these approaches expose a persistent tension between **flexibility** and **efficiency**.

- **Integration-based methods** (Diffusion, Flow Matching) are highly expressive: by refining the solver and step schedule, they can approximate the underlying continuous dynamics more accurately. However, they are often computationally expensive in practice, requiring dozens to hundreds of sequential network evaluations (NFEs). Their quality is tightly coupled to discretization choices: step count, schedule shape, and whether guidance or editing introduces additional stiffness into the dynamics.

- **Distillation-style shortcuts** (e.g., Consistency Models) sit at the other extreme. They can generate in 1–2 steps, but this speed typically comes with structural rigidity: the model effectively learns a mapping anchored to a fixed endpoint (most commonly $$s=0$$). This endpoint anchoring can induce a form of *schedule lock-in*: changing step counts, inserting intermediate stops, or running back-and-forth editing procedures becomes fragile because the model is not explicitly trained to represent the geometry of intermediate time states.

In many modern workflows—guided generation, iterative editing, multi-stage refinement, or any pipeline that composes multiple time jumps—we would like a primitive that is **richer than a single endpoint projection**, yet **cheaper than numerical integration**. This motivates the central idea of this post: instead of treating sampling as “integrate an infinitesimal field,” we learn a **two-time solution operator** that can jump from any $$t$$ to any $$s$$ directly. In the next section, we formalize this as the **Flow Map Paradigm**.



## 2. The Flow Map Paradigm



Sampling in continuous-time generative models is usually described as “following a trajectory”: start from a noisy state and repeatedly integrate an infinitesimal dynamics (a score field or a velocity field). Here we propose a different primitive.

Instead of treating the **vector field** as the main object and numerical integration as the inevitable inference engine, we elevate the **finite-time solution operator** to the center stage. Concretely, we consider the family of two-time maps

$$
\Phi_{t\to s}:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}^d,
$$

which answers the question: If the system is at state $x_t$ at time $t$, where will it be at time $s$?

Throughout this post we adopt the denoising convention $t\in[0,1]$, where $t=1$ is the noisiest endpoint and $t=0$ is the clean/data endpoint, so a typical generation step is a **backward-time jump** with $s\le t$.





### 2.1. From trajectories to operators



Consider a time-dependent vector field $v_{\phi}(x,t)$ defining the ODE

$$
\frac{dx}{dt}=v_{\phi}(x,t).
$$

The vector field specifies **local** motion. The flow map $\Phi_{t\to s}$ instead specifies **global transport**: given the initial condition $x(t)=x_t$, it returns the state at time $s$. Equivalently, it satisfies the integral form

$$
x_s=\Phi_{t\to s}(x_t)\triangleq x_t+\int_t^s v_{\phi}(x_\tau,\tau)\,d\tau,
\qquad 0\le s\le t\le 1.
\tag{2.1}\label{eq:21}
$$


The **Flow Map Paradigm** reframes generative modeling from an **integration problem** to a **function approximation problem**. Instead of solving the integral at inference time, we train a neural network $f_\theta(x_t, t, s)$ to approximate the operator directly:

$$
f_\theta(x_t, t, s) \approx \Phi_{t\to s}(x_t).
$$

A well-defined flow map is not an arbitrary function of $(x,t,s)$; it is constrained by the algebra of dynamical systems. Two properties are especially fundamental:

1.  **Identity:** For any time step $t$,
    
    $$\Phi_{t\to t}(x) = x$$

2.  **Semigroup (Composition) Property:** For any intermediate time $u$ between $t$ and $s$,
    
    $$
    \Phi_{u\to s} \circ \Phi_{t\to u} = \Phi_{t\to s}.
    $$

These identities act as the “physics” of the operator: they encode path-independence of time slicing. In later sections, this is exactly what will let us diagnose and reduce **compositional drift** in multi-hop generation/editing pipelines.


### 2.2. Unifying Existing Methods

The Flow Map formulation provides a generalized coordinate system for understanding recent acceleration techniques. As illustrated in Figure 1, we can interpret existing models as restricting the flow map $f_\theta(x, t, s)$ to specific subsets of the time domain $(t, s)$.

{% include figure.liquid
   path="assets/img/2026-04-27-flow-map-learning/flow_map_vs_four_paradigms_clean.png"
   class="img-fluid"
   caption="Figure 1. Flow maps as a unifying operator view."
%}

*   **Consistency Models (CM) are Boundary Operators:**
    CMs restrict the target time to the data endpoint $s=0$ and learn only the boundary slice:

    $$ f_\theta^{\text{CM}}(x_t, t) \equiv f_\theta(x_t, t, 0). $$
    
    **Limitation:** because the model never represents $s>0$ explicitly, arbitrary stop-and-go schedules (or back-and-forth edits) often require extra heuristics (e.g., go to $x_0$ then re-noise), which can accumulate error across hops.

*   **Flow Matching (FM) is the Infinitesimal Limit:**
    Flow Matching learns the local velocity field $v_\phi(x,t)$. In flow-map language, this corresponds to learning the first-order infinitesimal behavior of the operator:

    $$ v_\phi(x,t) = \lim_{s\to t} \frac{f_\theta(x, t, s) - x}{s-t}. $$
    
    **Limitation:** to realize a finite jump $t\to s$, we still need numerical integration (many NFEs), unless further distilled.

*   **MeanFlow is a Linearized Operator:**
    MeanFlow <d-cite key="geng2025mean"></d-cite> parameterizes the map using an average velocity $u_\theta$:

    $$ f_\theta(x, t, s) = x + (s-t)u_\theta(x, t, s). $$

    where 

    $$
    u_{\theta}(x_t,t,s) \approx \frac{1}{s-t}\,\int_{t}^{s} v_\theta(x_\tau,\tau)\,d\tau.
    $$

    
    This enforces a linear inductive bias on the trajectory between $t$ and $s$.

*   **Consistency Trajectory Models (CTM) are Discrete Compositions:**
    CTM <d-cite key="kim2023consistency"></d-cite> enforces the composition property on a discrete grid of time steps, acting as a discretized surrogate of the full flow map algebra:

    $$ f_\theta(f_\theta(x, t_2, t_1), t_1, t_0) \approx f_\theta(x, t_2, t_0). $$

Under the operator-centric view, methods such as MeanFlow and Consistency Trajectory Models (CTM) can be interpreted as concrete instantiations of flow-map learning, differing mainly in parameterization and which parts of the two-time operator are explicitly represented and constrained.


### 2.3. Why Operators? Speed, Control, and Composability


Lifting the abstraction from **trajectories** to **operators** buys us three practical advantages:


1.  **Amortization of Integration (Speed):**
    Once $f_\theta$ is trained, a finite jump $t\to s$ is a single network evaluation. Unlike boundary-only maps, the operator can directly target any intermediate $s$, rather than always “touching” $s=0$.

2.  **Decoupling Physics from Discretization (Control):**
    Trajectory-based samplers entangle the ODE dynamics with the solver's step size. With a flow map, the "desired jump" $(t, s)$ is an explicit input. This makes the model robust to changing step counts and enables non-uniform schedules tailored to specific editing tasks.

3. **Algebraic consistency (Composability).**  
   Many real pipelines require chaining time jumps (e.g., iterative editing, refine-and-correct loops). If $f_\theta$ respects semigroup structure, then “direct” and “composed” jumps agree:

   $$
   \Phi_{t\to s}\approx \Phi_{u\to s}\circ\Phi_{t\to u},
   $$
   
   which directly suppresses drift accumulation. This gives us not only better behavior in composed pipelines, but also a concrete diagnostic: *semigroup violation* becomes a measurable unit test for learned generative operators.


## 3. Training Two-Time Operators via Eulerian and Lagrangian Distillation


In Chapter 2, we elevated generative modeling from <b>integrating infinitesimal dynamics</b> to <b>learning finite-time operators</b>.
We now turn to the central practical question: how can we train a neural operator
$$f_\theta(x_t, t, s) \approx \Phi_{t\to s}(x_t)$$
without placing an expensive ODE solver inside the training loop?



Assume we have a teacher dynamics (e.g., probability-flow ODE or rectified-flow ODE) governed by a velocity field

$$\frac{dx}{dt} = v_\phi(x,t), \qquad 0 \le s \le t \le 1.$$

A naive approach would sample many $(t,s)$ pairs and numerically integrate the teacher from $t$ to $s$ to obtain supervision. This is prohibitively costly. Instead, we exploit two identities of flow maps:

- How the map changes when we move the <b>target time</b> $s$ (Lagrangian view),
- How the map changes when we move the <b>start time</b> $t$ (Eulerian view).

Both lead to <b>one-step</b> distillation losses that require only a small teacher step / teacher velocity evaluation.




### 3.1. The Lagrangian View: Moving the Endpoint

{% include figure.liquid
   path="assets/img/2026-04-27-flow-map-learning/lagrangian_view.gif"
   class="img-fluid"
%}



<p>
Fix a starting state $x_t$ at time $t$, and view $\Phi_{t\to s}(x_t)$ as a function of the endpoint $s$.
Following the same particle along the trajectory yields the standard identity (flow-map derivative in the target time):
</p>

$$
\frac{d\Phi_{t\to s}(x_t)}{ds} = \frac{\partial}{\partial s} \Phi_{t\to s}(x_t) = v_\phi(\Phi_{t\to s}(x_t), s)
$$

<p>
<b>Interpretation.</b> As we move the endpoint $s$, the output moves according to the teacher velocity evaluated at the current location on the trajectory. This suggests a natural “predict-then-correct” distillation rule <d-cite key="boffi2025flow"></d-cite>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Lagrangian Map Distillation (LMD) <d-cite key="sabour2025align"></d-cite>.</b>
Choose a small fraction $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$ and define an intermediate endpoint
$$s' = s + \varepsilon (t-s), \qquad \text{so that } s < s' < t.$$
Then a first-order (backward-in-time) Euler correction from $s'$ to $s$ gives:
</p>

$$
\Phi_{t\to s}(x_t)\;\approx\;\Phi_{t\to s'}(x_t) + (s-s')\,v_\phi(\Phi_{t\to s'}(x_t),\, s').
$$

<p>
We implement this without integrating the teacher trajectory: we let a target/EMA network $f_{\theta^-}$ propose
a state at time $s'$, and use the teacher velocity to correct it by one step.
The LMD objective becomes:
</p>

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{LMD}}
=
\mathbb{E}_{t,s,\varepsilon}\Bigg[
\Big\|
f_\theta(x_t,t,s)
-
\Big(
f_{\theta^-}(x_t,t,s')
+
(s-s')\,v_\phi\big(f_{\theta^-}(x_t,t,s'),\,s'\big)
\Big)
\Big\|^2
\Bigg].
$$

<p>
<b>Why this helps.</b> LMD directly ties the predicted endpoint to the teacher dynamics: the student is trained to land on a
state that is consistent with the teacher’s velocity <i>at that future point</i>.
Empirically, this stabilizes “where you end up” for arbitrary $(t,s)$ jumps and reduces endpoint bias that often appears
when a model is trained only to hit a single boundary (e.g., $s=0$).
</p>



### 3.2. The Eulerian View: Moving the Start

{% include figure.liquid
   path="assets/img/2026-04-27-flow-map-learning/eulerian_view.gif"
   class="img-fluid"
%}



<p>
Now fix the destination time $s$ and study how the operator changes when we perturb the start time $t$.
This is an <b>Eulerian</b> viewpoint: instead of following a particle, we ask how the map itself must transform
so that the final destination at time $s$ remains invariant.
</p>

<p>
From the semigroup law $\Phi_{t\to s} = \Phi_{t'\to s}\circ \Phi_{t\to t'}$ and a first-order expansion,
one obtains the transport (backward) equation for ODE flow maps <d-cite key="boffi2025flow"></d-cite>:
</p>

$$
\frac{d\Phi_{t\to s}(x)}{dt} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\,\Phi_{t\to s}(x)
+
J_x \Phi_{t\to s}(x)\, v_\phi(x,t)
=
0.
$$

<p>
<b>Equivalent “pre-transport” intuition.</b>
If we move the start time from $t$ to a slightly later (closer-to-$s$) time $t'$,
we should first push the input $x_t$ along the teacher flow from $t$ to $t'$,
and then apply the operator from $t'$ to $s$:
</p>

$$
\Phi_{t\to s}(x_t)\;\approx\;\Phi_{t'\to s}(x_{t'}),\qquad
x_{t'} \approx x_t + (t'-t)\,v_\phi(x_t,t).
$$

<p>
<b>Eulerian Map Distillation (EMD) <d-cite key="sabour2025align"></d-cite>.</b>
Pick the same $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$ and define
$$t' = t + \varepsilon(s-t), \qquad \text{so that } s < t' < t.$$
We compute a single teacher Euler step to obtain $x_{t'}$ and enforce consistency under this transport:
</p>

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{EMD}}
=
\mathbb{E}_{t,s,\varepsilon}\Big[
\big\|
f_\theta(x_t,t,s) - f_{\theta^-}(x_{t'},t',s)
\big\|^2
\Big].
$$

<p>
<b>Connection to consistency-style training.</b>
When $s$ is fixed to the boundary (e.g., $s=0$), this becomes the familiar “start-time invariance” constraint
behind consistency-type objectives—here generalized to arbitrary destinations $s$.
</p>





### 3.3. Synthesis: A Unified Objective


<p>
LMD and EMD provide complementary supervision signals:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Lagrangian (LMD)</b> constrains <b>endpoint correctness</b>:
    the jump must land on a state that is locally consistent with the teacher velocity at the predicted location.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Eulerian (EMD)</b> constrains <b>start-time consistency</b>:
    shifting the start time and transporting the input accordingly should not change the final prediction.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
A practical training objective is a weighted combination:
</p>

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{FMAP}}
=
\lambda_{\mathrm{L}}\,\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{LMD}}
+
\lambda_{\mathrm{E}}\,\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{EMD}}.
$$

<p>
<b>What this buys us.</b>
Unlike endpoint-only shortcuts, the combined objective learns a <i>two-time</i> primitive:
it can jump to arbitrary $s$ (control), remains stable under varying step schedules (robustness),
and is structurally aligned with semigroup composition (composability).
This sets up the experimental questions in the next chapter: are learned jumps indeed less sensitive to NFE,
and do they exhibit smaller drift under multi-hop composition?
</p>


## 4. Experiments



In the previous sections, we proposed a shift from **trajectory integration** (solving an SDE/ODE step-by-step) to **operator learning** (predicting the jump $\Phi_{t\to s}$ directly). This theoretical reframing leads to two verifiable hypotheses regarding the behavior of generative models:

1.  **Robustness to Discretization:** If a model learns the finite-time operator directly, its generation quality should be decoupled from the inference step count (NFEs), unlike solvers that rely on infinitesimal approximations.
2.  **Algebraic Consistency (Semigroup Property):** a genuine flow map should approximately satisfy the semigroup law $$\Phi_{u\to s} \circ \Phi_{t\to u} \approx \Phi_{t\to s}$$, so chaining multiple jumps should induce **small drift** compared to a direct jump. 


To validate these claims without repeating ourselves, we use **two experiments under a shared inpainting setup**:

* **Exp-I (Step sensitivity, Sec 4.3) :** Compare integration-based samplers (SDE/ODE) vs jump-distilled samplers (CM-like / Flow-like) under different NFEs. This answers **why jumps help at low steps.**

* **Exp-II (Composition drift, Sec 4.4) :** Compare **direct** $$\Phi_{t\to s}$$ vs **composed** $$\Phi_{u_{k-1}\to s}\circ\cdots\circ\Phi_{t\to u_1}$$ for different hop counts $k$. This answers **why two-time operators are more stable than endpoint-anchored jumps in multi-hop pipelines.**


### 4.1. Shared experimental setup (common to both experiments)

**Task: image inpainting.** Given an image $$x\in\mathbb{R}^{H\times W}$$ and a binary mask $$m\in\{0,1\}^{H\times W}$$, the goal is to fill the masked region $\Omega$ (where $$\Omega=\{(i,j) \mid m_{ij}=1\}$$) in a way consistent with the context and text prompt. This is a good stress test for step robustness because failures often show up as geometry glitches or texture incoherence when NFEs are too small. 

**Backbone & pipeline.** We use the same Stable Diffusion v1.5 inpainting backbone instantiated via `AutoPipelineForInpainting`, and vary only the scheduler / distilled head (LoRA) depending on the method. 

**Methods.** We compare four inference paradigms built on the same backbone (same prompt encoder / VAE / UNet weights unless stated otherwise):

* **SDE-like sampler:** Euler ancestral discretization (`EulerAncestralDiscreteScheduler`). 
* **ODE-like sampler (probability-flow style):** deterministic DDIM (`DDIMScheduler`, $$\eta=0$$). 
* **Endpoint-jump distillation (CM-like, proxy):** `LCMScheduler` <d-cite key="luo2023latent"></d-cite> with an LCM LoRA fused into the pipeline. 
* **Two-time jump distillation (Flow-like, proxy):** `TCDScheduler` <d-cite key="zheng2024trajectory"></d-cite> with a TCD LoRA fused into the pipeline (used as a practical approximation to “two-time operator distillation”). 

**Fairness controls (Exp-I & Exp-II).** To isolate step/schedule effects rather than prompt/guidance variance, we enforce:

* Same inpainting input (image + mask) and same prompt/negative prompt.
* Same step budgets (Exp-I uses ({2,4,8,16,30}), and Exp-II uses ({2,4,6,8})).
* Same random seed and the same guidance scale across all methods. 

**Extra controls for composition drift (Exp-II).** Because composition drift is subtle, we add two controls specifically for Exp-II:

* **Fixed noise for the endpoint re-noise step** in the CM-proxy, so drift reflects structural inconsistency rather than stochastic variance. 
* **Unmasked-region locking:** we explicitly lock the unmasked context region to a shared reference latent trajectory at every intermediate time, ensuring the metric measures drift only inside the edited region. 



### 4.2. A note on “proxies”: what we *did* and *did not* implement

A key practical detail is that we do **not** train a full flow-map network $$f_\theta(x_t,t,s)$$ from scratch in this blog post. Instead, we use **public distilled LoRAs <d-cite key="hu2022lora"></d-cite>** as **stand-ins** for two different structural paradigms:

- **LCM-LoRA as an endpoint-jump proxy (CM-like):** it behaves like a boundary map $$B_t(x_t)\approx x_0$$, and any $$t\to s$$ jump is synthesized via “denoise to $x_0$, then re-noise to $s$”.

- **TCD-LoRA as a two-time-jump proxy (Flow-like):** we treat the model as supporting a DDIM-coupled jump $$a\to b$$ that depends on the target time through $$(\alpha_b,\sigma_b)$$, rather than always anchoring at $$t=0$$. 

Concretely, in Exp-II we instantiate two “operators”:

* **Flow-proxy jump (DDIM-coupled):**
  
  $$
  \Phi^{\text{flow}}_{a\to b}(x_a)
  = \frac{\alpha_b}{\alpha_a} x_a + \Bigl(\sigma_b-\frac{\alpha_b}{\alpha_a}\sigma_a\Bigr)\,\varepsilon_\theta(x_a,a),
  $$

  where $$\varepsilon_\theta$$ comes from the TCD-distilled predictor and $$(\alpha_t,\sigma_t)$$ are from a reference DDIM schedule. 

* **CM-proxy jump (endpoint-anchored):**
  
  $$
  \Phi^{\text{CM}}_{a\to b}(x_a)
  = \alpha_b\,B_a(x_a) + \sigma_b\,\epsilon_0,
  $$

  where $$B_a(x_a)$$ is a learned endpoint map: $$x_a \to x_0$$, comes with a fixed $$\epsilon_0$$ shared across all compositions. 

**Why this is still meaningful.** Our goal is **not** to claim “we trained the definitive flow map.” The goal is to empirically test a *structural hypothesis* from Chapters 2–3: **multi-hop pipelines should be more stable when the underlying primitive is a genuine two-time operator (semigroup-consistent), and less stable when every hop must “return to $$x_0$$” as an anchor.**

Even with proxies, Exp-II directly measures the **semigroup violation diagnostic** (direct vs composed). As long as the two proxies reflect the two paradigms (endpoint-anchored vs time-to-time jump), the diagnostic remains aligned with the theory.

**Limitation (explicit):** the absolute numerical values of drift depend on the particular checkpoints; a true $$f_\theta(x_t,t,s)$$ trained with explicit composition constraints could reduce drift further. We view the proxy study as an **evidence-of-principle** validation.




### 4.3. Exp-I: Inpainting under different NFEs (Robustness to Discretization)

We first test whether jump-based inference indeed reduces step sensitivity. Using the common setup in Sec. 4.1, we run each method with step counts ({2,4,8,16,30}) and visualize the inpainted outputs, as shown in Figure 2.

{% include figure.liquid
path="assets/img/2026-04-27-flow-map-learning/compare_inpaint_dog.jpg"
class="img-fluid"
caption="Figure 2. Inpainting results vs NFE. Integration-based samplers (SDE/ODE) are sensitive to step count; jump-distilled samplers (LCM/TCD) are stable at very small NFEs."
%}

**Observation.** The qualitative trend is consistent:

* **SDE/ODE (integration)** are notably worse at very low NFEs and improve as NFEs increase, as expected from discretization/integration error accumulation. 

* **LCM/TCD (jump-distilled)** already produce plausible inpaintings at 2 steps and change less across the step range. 

**Interpretation.** This experiment supports the “trajectory vs operator” narrative: once inference is amortized into learned jumps, the output becomes less tied to the solver resolution (step count). Importantly, Exp-I is **not** meant to separate CM vs FlowMap; at this level both are “jump” methods, so the main takeaway is **jump distillation vs integration**. 



### 4.4. Exp-II: Direct vs composed jumps (composition drift diagnostic)

Exp-I shows that jump distillation helps at low NFEs. Exp-II asks a stricter question tied to flow-map algebra: If we want to jump from $t$ to $s$, does it matter whether we do it directly, or via multiple intermediate hops?

**Protocol Setup: direct vs $k$-hop composition**

For each trial we sample a start time $t$, an end time $$s\approx 0$$, and $$k-1$$ intermediate times

$$
t > u_1 > \dots > u_{k-1} > s.
$$

We compare:

* **Direct:** 
  
  $$x_s^{\text{dir}} = \Phi_{t\to s}(x_t)$$

* **Composed:** 

  $$x_s^{\text{comp}} = \Phi_{u_{k-1}\to s}\circ\cdots\circ\Phi_{t\to u_1}(x_t)$$

Ideally, for a valid flow map, **Direct $\approx$ Composed**. We define the **Compositional Drift** as the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between these two outputs in the latent space.

$$
\Delta_k=\mathrm{MSE}_{\text{mask}}\!\left(x_s^{\text{dir}},x_s^{\text{comp}}\right),
\qquad k\in \{2,4,6,8\}.
$$ 

**Quantitative Result: Error Accumulation**

{% include figure.liquid

class="img-fluid"
caption="Figure 3. Composition drift $\Delta_k$ (masked latent MSE, log-scale) vs hop count. Flow-proxy (TCD) shows much smaller drift and slower growth than CM-proxy (LCM)."
%}

Figure 3 reveals a stark difference in algebraic properties:

*   **Flow Map (Left):** The drift is minimal ($10^{-2}$ range) and grows slowly with hops. This indicates the model has learned a "straight" transport path where $\Phi_{t \to s}$ acts as a true semi-group.
*   **CM (Right):** The drift is an order of magnitude larger ($10^{-1} \to 10^0$) and grows faster than Flow Map. Every time the CM "touches the boundary" ($x_0$) and comes back, it introduces prediction error that compounds rapidly.

**Qualitative Result: Semantic Drift**

To make the effect tangible, we also decode “direct vs composed” and visualize $$\|\Delta\|$$ in image space (masked region only). Under ideal semigroup consistency (direct $$\approx$$ composed), the residual map  $$\|\Delta\|$$ should be negligible (nearly black).

*   **CM Failure:** The "CM Composed" image shows the object on the stool mutating into a black-and-white artifact. The $\|\Delta\|$ map is bright, indicating severe pixel-level deviation.
  
*   **Flow Success:** The "Flow Composed" image is visually  closer to the "Direct" one. The $\|\Delta\|$ map is nearly black.
  
**Interpretation.** This experiment operationalizes semigroup consistency: the flow-proxy behaves closer to a path-independent two-time operator, while the endpoint-anchored CM-proxy accumulates drift because each hop reprojects to an estimated $$x_0$$ and then re-noises—small endpoint errors become amplified across hops.  







## 5. Conclusion

This post advocated a simple shift in abstraction: **from integrating trajectories to learning operators**. Instead of treating sampling as the repeated numerical solution of an ODE/SDE, we view generation as composing **finite-time maps**. The flow map family $$\{\Phi_{t\to s}\}$$ is the minimal object that retains *control* (arbitrary start/stop times) while enabling *speed* (amortized jumps), and its algebraic structure—**identity** and the **semigroup law**—acts as the “physics” that distinguishes a genuine two-time operator from a boundary-only shortcut.

We then showed how this operator view organizes a large body of recent work:
- Consistency Models emerge as **boundary operators** $$f_\theta(x_t,t,0)$$, fast but structurally rigid.
- Flow Matching is the **infinitesimal limit** of a flow map, flexible but expensive at inference.
- MeanFlow and CTM can be interpreted as intermediate points that impose linearization or discrete composition constraints.

On the training side, we derived two complementary distillation perspectives:

- The **Lagrangian view (LMD)** supervises **how the endpoint moves** with the target time $s$, anchoring the operator to the teacher’s dynamics.
- The **Eulerian view (EMD)** supervises **how the operator evolves** with the start time $t$, enforcing invariance under transport and connecting naturally to consistency-style objectives.
  
Together, they suggest that "learning $$\Phi_{t\to s}$$" is not a single recipe but a **design space**: which derivatives you match (and how strongly you enforce composition) determines how well the learned operator behaves under chaining and editing.

Finally, we proposed two concrete, falsifiable hypotheses for operator learning and tested them under a shared inpainting setup:

1. **Robustness to discretization:** jump-based inference should be less sensitive to the step budget than integration-based sampling.

2. **Algebraic consistency:** if an operator is semigroup-consistent, **direct** and **composed** jumps should agree, and the discrepancy should grow slowly with hop count.

Even with practical proxies (LCM as endpoint-anchored, TCD as DDIM-coupled two-time jump), the experiments support the central narrative: **operator-like jumps are step-robust, and two-time jumps exhibit substantially lower compositional drift than endpoint-anchored hops**. This points to a useful takeaway beyond any specific method: **“semigroup violation” can serve as a unit test for generative operators**, especially in pipelines that repeatedly jump across time (editing, multi-stage refinement, or back-and-forth schedules).

### Limitations and Outlook

Our study deliberately prioritized *structure* over *full-scale training*: we did not train a complete $$f_\theta(x_t,t,s)$$ with explicit semigroup regularization. The next step is therefore clear: train true flow maps with (i) broad coverage over $(t,s)$, (ii) explicit composition constraints, and (iii) evaluation on tasks where chaining is unavoidable (e.g., iterative editing loops, guided refinement schedules, and long-horizon compositions). If successful, operator learning could offer a principled route to **fast** generation that remains **composable**, **controllable**, and **stable under changing schedules**—precisely where many endpoint-anchored distillations tend to break.
